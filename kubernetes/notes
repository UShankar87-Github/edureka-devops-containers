K8s Architecture:
API Server ---> Gatekeeper, validates the yaml
Scheduler --> schedules K8s objects on nodes
Controller Manager --> Overall health of the cluster
etcd --> database --> lighweight, centralized, key-value pair DB

Kubelet --> makes sure containers are runnig healthy
kube-proxy --> core networking component in the cluster


4 main K8s objects / resources:
1. Pod --> actual applications are depoyed
2. Replica Set --> To maintain a stable number of pods
3. Deployment --> Deploy without DOWNTIME, Rollbacks (deployment history)
4. Services --> To expose the pods, services are deployed
  a. NodePort --> to expose the front-end pods
  b. LoadBalancer --> to load balancer the traffic across multiple nodes
  c. ClusterIP --> For the communication between front-end pods and backend pods


Kubernetes uses "containerd" as the container engine
